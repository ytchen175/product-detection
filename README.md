Product Detection is an image recognition competition held by Shopee.

All the dataset is the actual commodity pictures in Shopee, and the target is to divide these into 42 categories.

After various experiments, I choose to undersample and image augmentation of non-uniform data first, then use EfficientNet as a base model to classify images.
